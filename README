Web radio receiver - DLNA audio renderer

Luigi Findanno 02/01/2016

Hardware:
1) Router with USB port supported by OpenWrt
1) USB hub
1) USB stick 1GB (only for extroot, perhaps not mandatory)
1) USB audio card (PCM2704 tested)
1) Arduino nano
1) LCD 16x2 display with PCF8574 I2C expander
2) Rotary encoder
1) 2 pole push button (230V)
1) LED (power on indicator)
1) 5V Relais transistor drived

Software:
Recompile OpenWrt is needed including the following packages:

stty
usbutils
block-mount
kmod-fs-ext4
kmod-usb-ohci
kmod-usb-serial
kmod-usb-serial-ch341
kmod-usb-serial-ftdi
kmod-usb-storage
kmod-usb-storage-exstras
kmod-sound-core
kmod-usb-audio
ffmpeg
madplay
mpd
mpc
upmpdcli
avrdude
usleep

You have to configure the wifi as client (sta) so you can disable dnsmasq to save memory.
Extroot is perhaps not mandatory but I did.
mpd and upmpdcli configuration is needed, see man pages.

Arduino connections:

LCD 16x2 I2C
SDA A4
SCL A5
First pole of push button  D4 (active HI)
Relay D5
Power on LED D5
Volume encoder D9 D10
Push button Volume encoder D7 (active LOW, mute function)
Tuner encoder D11 D12

Relay contacts:

Common and Normally Open contacts are in serie with 230V.
The second pole of push button is in parallel to them.
