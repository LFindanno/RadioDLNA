TODO

At this moment the wifi configuration is done manually editing the following file:

/etc/config/wireless
/etc/config/network

In the future version a setup push button is expected (rear panel).
It reset the current wifi configuration and set the router as access point
without encription.
A web page allow to configure the wifi settings.
